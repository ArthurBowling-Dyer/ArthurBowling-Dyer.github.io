    <p>Hi, my name is Arthur Bowling-Dyer. I am an incoming sophmore at Berkeley High School. I am also a 1st year at SMASH Berkeley. I am currently in the Pacific Boychoir Academy highschool choir. As you might or might not have noticed, I love to sing. Aside from the Pacific Boychoir, I am also part of my churches children and youth choir. Honestly, somtimes I think I sing too much. </p></body>
